# House Price Prediction

**House Price Prediction** is a Flask-based web application used to predict the prices of houses in Bangalore based on various factors such as location, BHK (bedrooms), number of bathrooms, and total square feet. Various regression algorithms were used, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest, and the best-performing algorithm was selected. Linear Regression outshoned other algorithms by achieving an accuracy of 86.81%.
